# django-svelte-c19

A "old" project I found depending on Django and Svelte. 

I was just experimenting with these framworks and it evolved into two parts. 

## \#1 Social Media

This was the main part, kind of a social media site with users + profiles, authentication, posts, comments, votes, groups + profiles, notifications and a search function.
I think I stopped on implementing the chat functionality.

## \#2 Cov 19 Panel

Here I created a dashboard where one could see the charts of the corona virus spread and compare the graphs with the ones of other countries on adding and removing them from the chart.
Then I created a similiar table like on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and added a info box for the social media part to displayed the data of the current day.

I used the data from following resources:
- https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/all
- https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries
- https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json'

I just uploaded it because it was a cool project with a contemporary context, maybe anyone can gain anything from it and I think it is good to polish a little bit my online repo for future job possibilities :D
